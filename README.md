# SBA – Bootstrap Contact Form (by-TN)

**Challenge:** Frontend Mentor – Contact Form (HTML/CSS)  
**Challenge link:** https://github.com/tiagolson-ux/sba-bootstrap-contact-form 
**Live site:** https://tiagolson-ux.github.io/sba-bootstrap-contact-form/
**Tech:** HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5.3 (Forms, Grid, Utilities)

---

## Approach (by-TN)

- Rebuilt the contact form using **Bootstrap’s grid system** and **form components** for accessibility and responsiveness.  
- Used **utility classes** for spacing, typography, and layout; kept custom CSS minimal (shadows, focus/hover).  
- Ensured color contrast, semantic tags, and responsive breakpoints meet accessibility standards.

2. Open `index.html` in a web browser  
   *(or right-click → “Open with Live Server” inside VS Code).*

## Notes (by-TN)

- Every label connects to an input via matching `for`/`id` attributes.  
- Built-in validation uses `required` and `type="email"`.  
- Semantic elements used: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`.
